### Anti-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)


### Originality
- To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose a new anti-UAV task, corresponding datasets, evaluation metrics and baseline methods.


### Task Definition
- Anti-UAV refers to discovering, detecting, recognizing, and tracking Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) targets in the wild and simultaneously estimate the tracking states of the targets given Near Infrared Ray (NIR) and/or RGB videos. When the target disappears, an invisible mark of the target needs to be given. A lot of higher-level applications can be founded upon anti-UAV, such as security of important area, defense against UAV attack, and protection from potential threat caused by UAV instrusion.


### Motivation
- The anti-UAV project of Institute of North Electronic Equipment, Beijing, China is proposed to push the frontiers of discovering, detection and tracking of UAVs in the wild.


- Recently, UAV is growing rapidly in a wide range of consumer communications and networks with their autonomy, flexibility, and a broad range of application domains. UAV applications offer possible civil and public domain applications in which single or multiple UAVs may be used. At the same time, we also need to be aware of the potential threat to our lives caused by UAV intrusion. Earlier this year, multiple instances of drone sightings halted air traffic at airports, leading to significant economic losses for airlines.


- The current computer vision research for UAV lacks a high-quality benchmark in dynamic environments. To mitigate this gap, this project presents a new benchmark dataset, evaluation metric, and baseline method for the area of discovering, detecting, recognizing, and tracking UAVs. The dataset consists of high quality, Full HD video sequences (both RGB and NIR), spanning multiple occurrences of multi-scale UAVs.


- In real world scenario, the setting of anti-UAV with multi-modality data is realistic and practical. Thus a task, corresponding datasets and baseline methods to consider discovering, detecting, recognizing, and tracking UAVs in the wild are highly desired.
