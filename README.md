### Anti-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)


### Originality
- To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose a new anti-UAV (detecting and tracking UAVs) task, corresponding datasets, evaluation metrics and baseline methods.


### Task Definition
- Anti-UAV refers to detecting and tracking Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) targets and simultaneously estimate the tracking states of the targets given Near Infrared Ray (NIR) and/or RGB videos. When the target disappears, an invisible mark of the target needs to be given.A lot of higher-level applications can be founded upon anti-UAV, such as security of important area, defense against UAV attack, and protection from potential threat caused by UAV instrusion.
